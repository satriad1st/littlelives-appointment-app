This document provides an overview of the database schema used in this project.

The database is powered by **MongoDB**, selected for its flexibility and schema-less design which allows easy iteration of data models over time.

## üìù Notes

- All date and time fields are stored as **string** using ISO date and "HH:mm" time formats.
- Business logic like checking overlaps, validating available slots, and excluding holidays is handled at the application level.

This schema supports a flexible and scalable appointment scheduling system.
